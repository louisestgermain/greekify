Greekify
====================

Purpose
---------------------

This web page takes text typed on a regular English (QWERTY) keyboard, and converts it to polytonic Greek.

The functionality is based on the [TypeGreek](http://www.typegreek.com) website, which has been extremely helpful to me for typing Ancient Greek. However, I am rewriting the JavaScript functionality from scratch for this website, both to improve my JavaScript skills, and to see if I can improve the algorithm efficiency/performance.


Still to Do
---------------------

[] Create functionality for adding accents (currently only converts the letters, not the accents)
[] Make the "convert to Greek" checkbox functional (currently does nothing)
[] Rebuild CSS for responsive layout
[] Create new branding and appearance for web page
